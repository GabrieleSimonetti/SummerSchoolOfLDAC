:SiteA a bot:Site ;

:BuildingA bot:hasStorey :Storey00 , :Storey01 .

# Since the range of bot:hasStorey is bot:Storey it is automatically 
# inferred that :Storey00 and :Storey01 are instances of bot:Storey.

# Since the range of bot:hasSpace is bot:Space it is automatically inferred

# Since bot:Site, bot:Building, bot:Storey and bot:Building are all sub classes of
# bot:Zone, :SiteA, :BuildingA, :Storey00 , :Storey01, :SpaceA, :SpaceB,
# :SpaceC and :SpaceD are all instances of bot:Zone

# Since bot:hasBuilding, bot:hasStorey and bot:hasSpace are all sub properties of

# :SiteA bot:containsZone :BuildingA .
# :BuildingA bot:containsZone :Storey00 , :Storey01 .
