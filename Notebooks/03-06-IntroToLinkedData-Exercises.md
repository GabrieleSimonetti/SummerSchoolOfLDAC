# Intro to Linked Data and Semantic Web: the Basics

Pieter Pauwels, Ghent University

Mads Holten Rasmussen, NIRAS

The first session of the LDAC summer school is about the vision and basics of the Semantic Web and Linked Data. You will be introduced to Linked Data in general, and with the work of the Linked Building Data (LBD) community group in particular. Through a number of slides, you will be introduced to the technical basics. More specifically, this session introduces the concept of linked data, graphs, ontologies, and graph-based information modelling in general. 

Through the exercises listed in this document, you’ll learn to think in terms of graphs about the built environment that surrounds you. More particularly, you will apply this to the room in which you are currently in. Furthermore, you’ll learn how to represent this room in an RDF graph, and you’ll be introduced to the concept of ontologies and vocabularies.

### Learning objectives
-	Understand the principles of Linked (Building) Data (LBD)
-	Understand the basics on what information can be described in ontologies
-	Construct an LBD-compliant RDF graph

## ASSIGNMENT 1 – WHERE IN THE GRAPH ARE WE???
Our environment can be described in many ways. Let’s describe our environment in a graph!

### Task 1.1
Take pen and paper and post-its. Define with nodes and arcs what building and space we are in.

Remember:
-	Nodes are in ellipses; literals are in rectangles
-	Every arc needs a label
-	Every element in the room needs to have a URI

## Task 1.2 
Evaluate: 
-	What terms did you use? 
-	What is vocabulary, what is data?
-	What could be re-used or defined by others?
-	Does every ‘thing’ have its own identifier or node?
-	Where are literals and where are nodes?

## Task 1.3
Evaluate: what kind of data was difficult to represent in a graph? What kind of data was easy to represent in a graph?

-	Did you include geometry?
-	Did you include time schedule data?
-	Why (not)?
